Release Philosophy

This section discusses topics related to |project| releases and version numbering.

**********************
Release and Deployment
**********************

.. warning::

   The |project| project does not yet have a template ``cmake3 --install`` definition and is not yet deployable to the
   W-13 Python Environments. Instead, users are directed to the :ref:`user_manual` and :ref:`build` section of the
   :ref:`devops_manual`.

The |project| project is built and installed as a c++ library in the `W-13 Python Environments`_ available on hamming,
sstelmo, and any local linux machines with home and project drives mapped from the W-13 NFS server. These are Anaconda
Python 3 environments with installed packages required for W-13 software development and engineering analysis. There are
two versions of the W-13 Python Environments:

1) release
2) beta

The release environment contains the deployed final release versions of W-13 software projects, e.g. Toolbox and ECMF,
as tested against the installed Python packages. The beta environment contains the deployed developer release of W-13
software projects. While the deployed projects in beta have been unit and integration tested, the beta environment may
include updated or new Python modules that result in less stable behavior. The beta environment is used to test W-13
software projects against an updated Python environment before releasing the new environment.

Version Numbers
===============

The |project| project follows the `PEP-440`_ standard for version numbering. The
final release version number uses the three component ("major.minor.micro")
scheme. The developer (a.k.a. dev or beta) version number follows the final
release number with an appended "+dev" local version number. The version numbers
correspond to git tags in the `upstream cpp\_stub repo`_ which point to a static
release of the |project| project.

Because the deployed release of the developer version is constantly updated
against development work, the version number found in the developer version
contains additional information. During deployment, the developer version number
is appended with the git information from the most recent build. This
information contains the most recent git tag ("major.minor.micro+dev") followed
by the number of commits since the last final release and a short hash.

Major Number
------------

The major number is expected to increment infrequently. After the first major release, it is recommended that the major
version number only increments for major breaking changes.

Minor Number
------------

The minor number is updated for the following reasons:

* New features
* Major internal implementation changes
* Non-breaking interface updates

Incrementing the minor version requires a manual update to the release number found in  the root ``CMakeLists.txt`` on a
dedicated release commit. Until the first major release, minor version changes may also contain breaking changes. It is
recommended that all minor version changes are announced to the user community prior to release.

Micro Number
------------

.. warning::

   The |project| project does not yet have a deploy script or CI job. Micro version numbers must be updated with a
   manual version change as described in the minor number section above. All version number updates require a manually
   created tag on the `upstream cpp\_stub repo`_'s master and dev branches. The dev->master merge commit should be tagged
   with the new version number. The feature->dev merge commit immediately preceding the dev->master merge commit should be
   tagged with the new version number and dev tag, e.g. ``0.0.1+dev``.

The micro number is automatically incremented after any merge from the
development (dev) branch into the release (master) branch. The micro version
number indicates the following changes:

* Bug fixes
* Minor internal implementation changes

Until the first major release, micro version number releases may be made without announcement at the discretion of the
lead developer. It is recommended that the developer community periodically discuss priorities for minor version release
with the user community.

Release Branch Requirements
===========================

.. warning::

   Until |project| project has an auto-deploy script that updates the micro version, the micro version will also require
   a dedicated release branch to update the version number. See Step 5. Remove this warning and step 5 when the
   auto-deploy scripts and CI jobs are confirmed functioning.

Major and minor version number updates require a release branch.
Releases correspond to a variety of bug fixes and features that characterize
the release, as documented in :ref:`changelog`.

Steps needed for a release include:

1. Update version number in the root ``CMakeLists.txt``, e.g. ``project(cpp_stub VERSION 0.0.1)``.
   Version bumps should be accompanied by resetting numbers to the right of the
   bump to zero, e.g., ``'0.2.30'`` to ``'0.3.0'`` and ``'1.2.30'`` to
   ``'2.0.0'``.
2. Modify ``docs/changelog.rst`` to update version release date and add next unreleased version section header.
3. Commit changes and submit a pull request to the upstream dev branch.
4. Immediately after release branch merge to dev, submit and merge the dev->master pull request.
5. If there are no auto-deploy scripts, update the Git tags on the upstream master and dev branches.

   * Tag the most recent dev->master merge commit with the new version, e.g. ``0.0.1``.
   * Tag the merge commit to the dev branch immediately preceding the new version with the dev version, e.g.
     ``0.0.1+dev``.
