.. note::

   This is a duplicate of the content found in the README with a manual
   conversion to ReST syntax. Markdown files can be included in ReST documents
   with a conda python environment module addition ``myst-parser`` completed in TOOL-389.
   Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46278683/include-my-markdown-readme-into-sphinx

   However, the README.md is broken into many separate subsections for the HTML documentation. Consequently, the
   duplicated information can't be reduced unless the README file is split up.
