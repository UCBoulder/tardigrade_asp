This project is built with `CMake`_ and uses `Sphinx`_ to build the documentation with `Doxygen`_ + `Breathe`_ for the
c++ API.

Build on sstelmo
================

1) Activate the correct python environment

   .. code:: bash

      $ module load python/2019.10-python-3.7
      $ sv3r

2) Create a build directory

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/

      $ mkdir build
      $ cd build

3) Configure ``cmake3``

   .. note::

      This step only needs to be performed once unless you need to specify a new CMake configuration for a re-build. Most
      command line arguments and environment variables are stored in the CMake cache. Anything found in cache will not be
      re-configured unless you remove the cache file or clobber the build directory.

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build
      $ cmake3 ..

4) Build various portions of the project

   .. note::

      Most of the project will re-build only as necessary after source updates. Some portions of the documentation
      require a ``make clean`` after documentation source file updates to force a re-build.

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build

      # Build everything
      $ cmake3 --build .

      # Build only the c++ primary libraries
      $ cmake3 --build src/cpp

5) Locate build files

   .. note::

      The build directory structure may change between version releases. Developers and users are encouraged to become
      familiar with the bash ``find``, ``grep``, and ``tree`` commands to locate build files.

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build

      # find c++ libraries and ignore intermediate files with similar extensions
      $ find . \( -name "*.o" -o -name "*.so" -o -name "*.a" \) | grep -vE "\.cpp\."

6) Clean build directory to force a re-build

   .. warning::

      The abaqus input files and bash scripts used for integration testing are built with the `CMake
      add\_custom\_target`_ feature. Consequently, the integration test target is *always considered out of date*. The
      integration test target copies all registered input files and the integration test bash script from source to build
      directory. This means the file copy operation is always performed when the integration test target is requested in the
      cmake build command, e.g. ``cmake --build .`` or ``cmake --build src/abaqus/tests``. This operation is computationally
      inexpensive with respect to building the VIPor source code.

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build

      $ make clean

Test on sstelmo
===============

4) Build tests of the project

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build

      # Build c++ tests
      $ cmake3 --build src/cpp/tests

5) Run the tests

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build

      # Run ctest
      $ ctest

      # Results print to screen
      # View details of most recent test execution including failure messages
      $ less Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

Convenience build wrappers
==========================

Two build scripts have been created for convenience, ``new_build.sh`` and
``build_docs.sh``. The first will build everything including the library binary,
the test binary, and the documentation. This is the same build script used by
``jenkins_build.sh`` for CI builds and testing. The ``build_docs.sh`` script
only builds the documentation. Both build scripts clobber existing build
directories, reset any bash environment variables, and run the cmake
configuration from scratch.

2) Build everything and run tests

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/

      # Just perform the build (pick one)
      $ ./new_build.sh <cxx compiler> <cmake build type>
      $ ./new_build.sh c++ None
      $ ./new_build.sh g++ None
      $ ./new_build.sh icpc None

      # Perform tests from PWD
      $ ./build/src/cpp/tests/test_cpp_stub

      # Build and perform tests
      $ ./jenkins_build.sh

3) View test results

   .. code:: bash

      # As built directly to PWD
      $ cat results.tex

      # As built by jenkins_build.sh
      $ cat build/src/cpp/tests/*_results.tex
      $ cat *results.tex

4) Display docs

   .. code:: bash

      # Sphinx
      $ firefox build/docs/sphinx/index.html &

      # Doxygen
      $ firefox build/docs/doxygen/html/index.html &

Building the documentation
==========================

.. note::

   **API Health Note**: The sphinx API docs are a work-in-progress. The doxygen
   API is much more useful.

The documentation can be built with ``build_docs.sh``. The steps used in that
shell script are repeated here.

To build just the documentation pick up the steps here:

2) Create the build directory and move there

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/
      $ mkdir build/
      $ cd build/

3) Run cmake3 configuration

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build/
      $ cmake3 ..

4) Build the docs

   .. code:: bash

      $ cmake3 --build docs

5) Documentation builds to:

   .. code:: bash

      cpp_stub/build/docs/sphinx/index.html

6) Display docs

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build/
      $ firefox docs/sphinx/index.html &

7) While the Sphinx API is still a WIP, try the doxygen API

   .. code:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/cpp_stub/build/
      $ firefox docs/doxygen/html/index.html &
